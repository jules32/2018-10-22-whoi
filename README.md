In the workshop we'll use the sticky notes to indicate whether everything is OK (blue) or not (yellow).

**If you've successfully installed everything listed in the course website setup instructions, please put a blue sticky note up on your laptop.** And put up yellow if you need help. Today we'll just be using R and RStudio, so if you need help with the others we can have a look during a break.
